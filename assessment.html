<p><b>Damage report!</b> Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. How long can two people talk about nothing? Computer, belay that order. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Your shields were failing, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?</p>
<br>
<p><em><b>You're</b> going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.</em></p>
<br>
<p><b>Captain</b>, why are we out here chasing comets? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. This should be interesting. Ensign Babyface! Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Talk about going nowhere fast. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I'll alert the crew. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Besides, you look good in a dress.</p>
